## Action Items DURING the Hackathon


* Create a [Github](https://www.github.com) repository


* Connect [Gitter](https://www.gitter.im) to your repository
   * Gitter is a chatroom that can be associated with your Github repository. This should help you and your team share information. Gitter has a number of nice features like Github markdown support.


* Hack!
   * Focus on proof of concept and demonstrating feasibility rather than polish.
   * Documentation and tutorial projects should include running example code.


* Create web page explaining project at `<project-name>.github.io` using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
   * Include: team members, problem statement(s), approach(es), what does and does not work, future TODOs, and opportunities for future collaboration.
   * Documentation projects should describe the initial state, what kinds changes were made (e.g. how-tos guides, enhanced code comments, improved developer guides, etc.).


* Present your project to the panel of judges.
   * We encourage every team member to present their contribution.
   * Projects will be judged on the content of their project, web page, and presentation.
